Are you, see through
Me too, see you
Show up, be brave
Goodbye, don't be asleep
I breathe, my breath, my dream, my strip
Are you gonna
Are you gonna fly with?

And I want your life in mine
Like the moments done
That's how good you are

Deserve, I kiss, the worth, my wish
Your turn, your move
Don't wait, don't chose
Your move, we crawl, through life
We were
Are you gonna
Are you gonna fly with?

And I want your life in mine
Like the moments done
That's how good you are

THE END
